- Product is largely nailed down, it will track students’ course grades
- Mostly for university students, undergraduate students in particular
- Lots of things in university that need to be tracked
- Do tasks need to be able to be broken down into subtasks? It is a good option
- Should be password protected
- Would like to see it completed in the next few months
- User stories:
	- Calculating grades/GPA
	- Viewing schedule
	- Viewing previous grades
	- Adding tasks/assignments
	- Study tool

Iteration 1
-------------

Main Screen (4 days)
- David worked on the GUI for main screen (1 day)
- David, Anthony and Yusef created main screen code (2 days)
- Group combined and fixed code for main screen(1 day)

Add Course (4 days)
- David, Anthony and Yusef created code for Add Course (3 days)
- Group combined and fixed code (1 day)

Course List (4 days)
- David, Anthony and Yusef created code for Course List (3 days)
- Group combined and fixed code (1 day)

Database (5 days)
- Ian created database (5 days)

	February 5, 2016
- Everyone is here but Graham
- Someone is going to take the lead for each of the iterations
- Group github account
- One user story for the first iteration needs to be implemented and tested
	- Course list, information
	- User accounts
	- Schedule
- Database stub to be stored on memory as a Class         

	February 8, 2016
- Graham is sick
- Breaking up tasks:
	- Ian & Graham -Stub Database
	- David & Yusuf & Anthony - GUI
- We’ll decide on another meeting over WhatsApp

	Ferbruary 21, 2016
- Combined David and Ian's code and cleaned up (Graham)

	February 22, 2016
- Code for database and GUI have been combined
- Wiki page has been created
- Student class is being created

February 26, 2016
- Iteration 2 needs the SQL database, and more user stories to be added
- we should also finish the adding course information feature
- for next iteration (guessing on description) from detailed stories:
	- tasks - 4 days - High Priority - Anthony
	- create profiles - 5 days - High Priority - David
	- grade calculation - 2 days - Low Priority
	- course information - 3 days - Medium Priority - Yusuf
	- SQL database - two weeks - High Priority - Ian & Graham
	- implement proper gui for course list - 2 days - High Priority
- need to have the stub implemented better for testing

March 8, 2016
- Made a rough class for TaskList and AddTask (Anthony)
- Made rough layout for the TaskList and AddTask screens (Anthony)

March 11, 2016
- Created Student class and added code to SQL to handle students. (Graham) 
- Added a StubDatabase subclass of SQLDatabase (dependency injection) and ran unit tests on it (Ian)

March 13, 2016
- Apparently my code didn't get pushed so Student class was replaced with User class by David. (Graham)
- Everything is coming together, SQL database seems to be working as intended.
- Added Task class and made a few naming changes for buttons. (Graham)
- Repackaged classes into appropriate levels. (Graham)
- Wrote unit tests for business classes (Ian)
- Removed bug from SQLDatabase's getUser() method, rewrote query to use rawQuery() method (Ian)
- There seems to be some issues with the Controllers, still uncertain if the database can be accessed everywhere
- Pushed Add Task and Task List layout and classes to Develop (Anthony)

March 14, 2016
- We all got together after class to put our code together and do some final testing. During this time we found that the SQLDatabase
began acting up and it doesn't recognize that we have a UserPassword column in our SQL table. After some research we concluded that the version of the database needed to be increased. We spent some time trying to figure this out, but ran out of time so we changed our code to use the StubDatabase.
- All the classes and activities where broken down into three layers representing business, data access and presentation layers 
- When we changed back to our StubDatabase we found that our Courses and Tasks were being added to the SubTable but the program was instantly calling a constructor and removing the added items so there is nothing to display in ListOfCourses and TaskList. We hard coded in a Course and Task to show that our code does in fact display these items.

-All the classes and activities where broken down into three layers representing business, data access and presentation layers 
- Managed to get the database working in the evening (Ian)

March 21, 2016
- Working on adding some new activities for refactoring (Ian)
	- task list will show only the task name
	- click on that task to see more detail and edit the record of it
	- then save changes to the database
	- tasks need to be editable s.t. they can have a score
	- same for courses
- Added grade calculator functionality for individual courses (Ian)
	- modified database to find tasks by associated course
	- added task detail page to edit course details including score
	- task detail page calculates the grade as a fraction of the weight
	-
